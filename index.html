            <div class="sub-div3">
              I'm Rodney Hinson, a Backend Developer specializing in developing RESTful APIs using Node.js and the Express.js framework. I am passionate about building efficient, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. With expertise in API design, database management, and server-side logic, I thrive on tackling complex technical challenges and delivering robust solutions. <br><br> Over the course of my experience, I’ve worked with technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, contributing to a range of impactful projects. These include a Library Management API for tracking books and users, an Advertisement Website API for managing ad content and analytics, and an EV Charging Station Locator Platform designed for Ghana. The platform integrates real-time station tracking and reservation features. I also played a significant role in developing an e-commerce platform during my internship with Corextreme, where I focused on cart management, order processing, user authentication, and dashboard optimization. <br><br> My focus is always on creating seamless user experiences by ensuring the backend is robust, reliable, and scalable. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and implementing secure systems to protect user data. I am constantly exploring new technologies and taking on challenges that push my technical boundaries. <br><br>Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
